Description: R is a very anti-human language. 
    The package aims to improve this dilemma and create a user-friendly drawing GUI for R.
    In addition, one purpose of creating the R package is to facilitate third-party software to call R for drawing, for example, "Phoenix WinNonlin" software calls R to draw the drug concentration versus time curve.
